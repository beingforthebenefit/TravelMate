# TravelMate Project Roadmap

## 1. Project Initialization & Setup

### Monorepo Structure:

- Use Yarn Workspaces to organize separate packages for the backend (NestJS) and frontend (Next.js).

### Frontend Setup:

- Next.js with the new App Router, Apollo Client, and Tailwind CSS.
- Global environment variables via .env.local.

### Backend Setup:

- NestJS with GraphQL, Prisma as the ORM, and PostgreSQL as the database.
- Data seeding scripts to populate sample data.

### Tooling & Configurations:

- ESLint, Prettier, and commit hooks (Husky and lint-staged) for code quality.
- GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and CI/CD.

### Dockerization:

- Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend.
- docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.override.yml for container orchestration and live reloading.

## 2. Backend API Implementation

### Database Schema & ORM:

- Define a Prisma schema for core entities: Users, Itineraries, Destinations, etc.

### GraphQL API:

- Develop resolvers, queries, and mutations to enable full CRUD operations.

### External API Integration:

- Integrate mapping services (e.g., Mapbox) to provide destination search and interactive maps.

### Testing:

- Write unit tests and integration tests for all services, resolvers, and Prisma interactions.

### Data Seeding:

- Implement a seed script to populate the PostgreSQL database with sample data.

## 3. Frontend Development

### Apollo Client Integration:

- Configure Apollo Client with a central client instance and wrap the app using a client component (via an ApolloProvider wrapper).

### UI & UX:

- Use Tailwind CSS to build a modern, responsive design.

### Pages & Components:

#### User Authentication:

- Build Login and Registration pages (with corresponding tests).

#### Itinerary Management:

- Create a dashboard to view, create, edit, and delete travel itineraries.

#### Destination Search & Interactive Maps:

- Build a page to search for destinations and display them on interactive maps (using libraries such as react-map-gl).

### Testing:

- Write unit and integration tests for React components and GraphQL queries.

## 4. Additional Features & Enhancements

### Real-Time Collaboration:

- Implement live updates (e.g., via WebSockets) for collaborative itinerary editing.

### Reviews & Ratings:

- Allow users to review and rate destinations.

### Recommendation Engine:

- Develop heuristic or ML-based recommendations for itineraries/destinations.

### Monitoring & Performance Testing:

- Ensure scalability and integrate monitoring tools for production.

## 5. Dockerization & CI/CD Setup

### Final Docker Configuration:

- Finalize Dockerfiles and docker-compose for production deployments.

### CI/CD Pipelines:

- Configure GitHub Actions to run automated tests, linting, building, and deployment scripts.

### Post-Deployment Monitoring:

- Set up monitoring and logging to track application performance in production.

## 6. Final Deployment

### Staging Environment:

- Deploy to a staging environment for final QA testing.

### Production Rollout:

- Launch on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Vercel, DigitalOcean).

### Ongoing Maintenance:

- Continuously monitor, update, and iterate on the application.
